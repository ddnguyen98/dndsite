# 3 and A Half Dragons

## The Application

The application I am wanting to build is a site that helps you create 3.5e D&D sheets. The site is mainly going to focus on that aspect with social functions such as a new board to let users know of events or other D&D related activities. You can also create a profile which will store your sheet on the server and also having the ability to look at other peoples creations by having the correct link.

## The Problem

The problem I am hoping to solve with this website is to have a more modern looking site compared to some others that are a bit ancient. I also want the user to be able to add custom spells, feats, and possibly items. This gives the user a more user friendly character sheet to interact with.


## Target Market

**Who are they?**

It seems my demographic consist of college students to older adults that had played in their youth. Though for the older audience they prefer pen an paper as to a more technological way of doing so. IE writing on paper instead of using a excel spreadsheet for example.

**Primary Gender**

From a study by David Louis Wilson, it seems a rather large majority of players are male.
50 people picked, 94% were make.

**Primary Age Range**

The age range starts at around 18 all the way till 67. Though the focus will be on younger adults that prefer using technology.

**Other identifiable traits**

College students at a medium income.

**Design Considerations** 

For design choices I would focus on more on the imagery of dungeon and dragons, as a good sheet makes the player glad that they will be looking at that for a rather large ammount of time.
